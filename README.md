# WordPress Editor Block for Cake

This is a custom block for the new WordPress. For more information about building custom blocks, see [WordPress Custom Editor Block](https://salferrarello.com/wordpress-custom-editor-block/).

## Background

With WordPress 5.0 a new block-based editing experience will be introduced. WordPress provides an API for creating these blocks and this is a plugin to add an example block.
